                So, you've decided to dive into the wonderful world of sourdough—congrats! 
                Before you can bake those beautifully golden loaves, you need one key ingredient:
                a sourdough starter. If the idea of keeping a living, fermenting blob sounds 
                intimidating, don't worry! A starter is surprisingly simple to make and even
                easier to maintain once you get the hang of it. This guide will walk you through
                step-by-step, from mixing your first batch to keeping it strong and active for years
                to come.

            <h3>What Is Sourdough Starter?</h3>
            <p>
                A sourdough starter is a simple mix of flour and water that ferments over time,
                growing wild yeast and good bacteria. It's what makes sourdough bread rise without
                using store-bought yeast. As it bubbles and develops, it gives the bread its signature
                tangy flavor.
            </p>

            <h3>How Long Will It Take?</h3>
            <p>
                Making a sourdough starter from scratch takes about 5 to 7 days, but it can sometimes
                take up to two weeks to become strong and active. <br>
                Days 1-2: Mix flour and water, and let it sit. Not much happens at first, but tiny bubbles
                may start appearing. <br>
                Days 3-4: It begins to smell a little tangy, and you'll see more bubbles as wild yeast
                and bacteria grow. Keep feeding it daily.<br>
                Days 5-7: Your starter should be doubling in size between feedings, super bubbly,
                and smell pleasantly tangy. It's now ready to bake with!<br>
                If your starter isn't quite there by day 7, don't worry—keep feeding it daily,
                and it'll get stronger over time!

                    <li>Digital scale</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Ingredients</strong>
                <p>For day one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>60 g whole wheat flour</li>
                    <li>60 g water</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For days 3-7:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>60 g unbleached all purpose flour or bread flour</li>
                    <li>60 g water</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <strong>Day 1</strong>
            <ol>
            <li>Add the 60 g of whole wheat flour and 60 g of water to your glass jar.</li>
            <li>Mix with fork until smooth; the consistency will be like a thick and pasty.</li>
            <li>Cover with lid and keep it in a warm spot (around 75F) for 24 hours.</li>
            </ol>

            <strong>Day 2</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Check to see if any small bubbles have formed (it's okay if you dont see any yet).</li>
                <li>If you want to stir it you can. You don't have to do anything else on day 2. Keep it in a warm spot for another 24 hours.</li>
            </ol>

            <strong>Days 3-7</strong>
            <ol>It's time to start the feeding process! As the starter begins to fermente, bubbles will form on the surface and the starter will rise.
                Eventually your starter will fall back down, indicating it's time to feed it.  </ol>
