                <p class="block">
                    So, you've decided to dive into the wonderful world of sourdough—congrats! 
                    Before you can bake those beautifully golden loaves, you need one key ingredient:
                    a sourdough starter. If the idea of keeping a living, fermenting blob sounds 
                    intimidating, don't worry! A starter is surprisingly simple to make and even
                    easier to maintain once you get the hang of it. This guide will walk you through
                    step-by-step, from mixing your first batch to keeping it strong and active for years
                 to come.

        </header>
            <p class="block">
                A sourdough starter is a simple mix of flour and water that ferments over time,
                growing wild yeast and good bacteria. It's what makes sourdough bread rise without
                using store-bought yeast. As it bubbles and develops, it gives the bread its signature
                tangy flavor.

                Making a sourdough starter from scratch takes about 5 to 7 days, but it can sometimes
                take up to two weeks to become strong and active. <br>
                <b>Days 1-2:</b> Mix flour and water, and let it sit. Not much happens at first, but tiny bubbles
                may start appearing. <br>
                <b>Days 3-4:</b> It begins to smell a little tangy, and you'll see more bubbles as wild yeast
                and bacteria grow. Keep feeding it daily.<br>
                <b>Days 5-7:</b> Your starter should be doubling in size between feedings, super bubbly,
                and smell pleasantly tangy. It's now ready to bake with!<br>
                If your starter isn't quite there by day 7, don't worry—keep feeding it daily,
                and it'll get stronger over time!

                <br>
                <p>A sourdough starter is a live fermented culture of flour and water used to naturally leaven bread.
                It captures wild yeast and beneficial bacteria from the environment, giving sourdough its signature tangy flavor
                 and chewy texture. With just a few days of feeding, your homemade starter will be ready to bake delicious, crusty loaves.
