                    So, you've decided to dive into the wonderful world of sourdough—congrats! 
                    Before you can bake those beautifully golden loaves, you need one key ingredient:
                    a sourdough starter. If the idea of keeping a living, fermenting blob sounds 
                    intimidating, don't worry! A starter is surprisingly simple to make and even
                    easier to maintain once you get the hang of it. This guide will walk you through
                    step-by-step, from mixing your first batch to keeping it strong and active for years
                 to come.

            <h3>What Is Sourdough Starter?</h3>
        </Header>
            <p class="block">
                A sourdough starter is a simple mix of flour and water that ferments over time,
                growing wild yeast and good bacteria. It's what makes sourdough bread rise without
                using store-bought yeast. As it bubbles and develops, it gives the bread its signature
                tangy flavor.

            <h3>How Long Will It Take?</h3>
        </header>
            <p class="block">
                Making a sourdough starter from scratch takes about 5 to 7 days, but it can sometimes
                take up to two weeks to become strong and active. <br>
                <b>Days 1-2:</b> Mix flour and water, and let it sit. Not much happens at first, but tiny bubbles
                may start appearing. <br>
                <b>Days 3-4:</b> It begins to smell a little tangy, and you'll see more bubbles as wild yeast
                and bacteria grow. Keep feeding it daily.<br>
                <b>Days 5-7:</b> Your starter should be doubling in size between feedings, super bubbly,
                and smell pleasantly tangy. It's now ready to bake with!<br>
                If your starter isn't quite there by day 7, don't worry—keep feeding it daily,
                and it'll get stronger over time!
